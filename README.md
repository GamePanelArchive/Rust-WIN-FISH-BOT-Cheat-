# About Rust Fishing Bot

Rust Fishing Bot is an automation software that allows you to automatically farm tons of scrap while you can be fully AFK. 

## The bot is capable to automatically:

- Catch fish
- Gut the caught fish for more bait
- Replace the bait
- Replace broken fishing rods
- Store fish into the box next to your character
- Eat/drink

Auto fishing should yield at least 1.5k scrap per hour and up to 2k scrap per hour depending on how well your fishing base is built. 

You can AFK for numerous hours until the bot is out of fishing rods or the box/inventory is filled with fish.
